## üìΩ About The Project

The project was implemented using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) ( is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects) and supported template react-ts.

On the project you can interact with the products (add them to the cart, favorites and compare them), all this are controlled by [Redux-toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - a predictable state container for apps. The database was made by hand in json file.

Dynamic routing in a web app by [React Router Dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main).

For styles i'm using CSS framework such as [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

The design was taken from free template in figma that I found [link to layout](https://www.figma.com/file/ONLxy79MIupF15LgQev8PB/eCommerce-Website-%7C-Web-Page-Design-%7C-UI-KIT-%7C-Interior-Landing-Page-(Community)).

Website animated with [framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - animation library.

I took the icons from [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons) - icons library for react apps.

The site is adapted to all screen sizes.

I will try to add new things to the project whenever possible and how I will learn something cool üëãüòâ.
